<h2>Investment Advice</h2>
<p> Our individual portfolio management is centered on a client's individual needs, time horizon, 
liquidity needs and risk tolerance, determined through the financial planning process. 
We also offer a pre-set model portfolio management services. Unlike individual portfolios, 
these portfolios are managed based on the portfolio's goals rather than on clients' individual 
goals, though we consider clients' unique circumstances when selecting a model portfolio. 
The firm has several model portfolios, which are designed to meet different risk and return 
profiles and which have equity exposure ranging from 0% to 100%. Typically, these portfolios 
are globally diversified and contain a combination of ETFs, 
no-load index funds and/or institutional class mutual fund shares.</p>

Retirement is one of the most important life events you’ll experience, and getting it right takes planning. 
Making sure you have a comfortable retirement from a personal and financial perspective is a long process 
that takes years of following a plan and continuous saving. Once you’ve reached your financial goals, 
managing your retirement is a continuing process that lasts the rest of your life. 
The time it takes and the complexity of building a retirement portfolio to make sure you’re financially 
secure and personally ready for retirement may seem daunting but the process isn’t as complicated as 
most people are led to believe. Use Retirement Living’s Retirement Calculator to evaluate your current 
retirement plan.</p>
